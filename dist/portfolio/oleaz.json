Let the items you don't use (anymore) bring in some money. Or just consume smarter and only pay to lease the items you need from time to time. Quick, easy and safely. As an o'leaz user, you are a part of a real and close community and you can count on the support of a motivated team that is always willing to help out. Leasing has never been this easy because of the user-friendly website. Or, as we say at o'leaz: \"Leasy peasy!\" <br><br>This site had to be responsive and work well on all devices. We used the <span class=\"highlight\">mobile-first</span> approach. We used <a href=\"http://gruntjs.com/\">Grunt</a> for automated tasks such as <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com/\">SCSS</a> preprocessing, and <a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">Git</a> for version control.","services":{"role":"front-end developer","service":"HTML, bootstrap, Sass, Grunt, Git, Responsive","with":"<a href=\"http://www.8trust.com/\">8trust</a>","when":"May 2015 - June 2015","website":"https://www.oleaz.com"},"images":["../images/oleazfull.jpg","../images/oleazsmall.jpg"]}
