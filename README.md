# portfolio

My personal portfolio. This site has been designed by me and built with AngularJS. The CSS is written in Sass. I use Grunt.js, a JavaScript task runner to automate repetitive tasks such as Sass compilation.

## Build & development

Run 'grunt build' for building and 'grunt serve' for preview. Run 'grunt serve:dist' for preview of the built website.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
