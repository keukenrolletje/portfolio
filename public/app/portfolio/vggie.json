	"description": "As vegetarians we had far too much personal experience with the typical restaurant search. The endless searching through google. The vegetarian restaurant listing sites that look like they were built in the 90’s. And the walking and driving through neighborhoods looking for vegetarian restaurants. That’s why we built vggie.com. The largest, most complete search and discovery tool for vegetarian restaurants. <br><br> This site is <span class=\"highlight\">fully responsive.</span> It's important for Vggie that users are able to search for restaurants while on the move.<br> For the frontend I used <a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a> and for the backend I experimented with <a href=\"http://laravel.com/\">Laravel.</a>",
